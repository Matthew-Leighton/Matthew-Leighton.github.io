		<p>Collagen is the single most abundant protein in the human body. Individual collagen molecules spontaneously self-assemble <i>in vivo</i> into fibrils, long molecular ropes, which are a key structural component in many different animal tissues (the prototypical example is tendons, but collagen fibrils can also be found in tissues such as skin, bone, cartilage, and cornea). Within these fibrils collagen molecules are highly ordered, leading to microscopically visible features such as longitudinal periodic density modulations and high angular surface twist. To understand the self-assembly of collagen fibrils <i>in vivo</i> we derived a nonequilibrium growth model for cross-linked fibrils, which predicts internal structure and radius control mechanisms consistent with experimental observations. We also extended results from the neoclassical theory of nematic rubber elasticity to the double-twist molecular director field of collagen fibrils in order to model the effects of applied strain on the complex macromolecular structures predicted by our growth model.

		<p><h3>Stochastic modelling of cellular <em>Salmonella</em> infection</h3>
		<p><i> With Professor <a href=http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~adr/>Andrew Rutenberg</a> </i>  
		<p> Salmonella bacteria are a prototypical labaratory pathogen exhibiting a particularly interesting behavioural trait: the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_ruffling>ruffling mechanism</a>. To better understand the impact of the ruffling on the statistics and dynamics of bacterial invasion, we developed an agent-based stochastic model for invasion of host cells by Salmonella bacteria. Using this model we were able to explain recent experimental data, determine environmental conditions under which stochastic effects are most significant, and gain quantitative insight into cooperative invasion behaviour. A manuscript detailing these results is currently under preparation.
