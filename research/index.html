		<h2>Research Projects</h2>

		<p><strong>Stochastic modelling of cellular <em>Salmonella</em> infection</strong>.
		<p>Worked with professor Andrew Rutenberg on mathematical and computational modelling of host-pathogen dynamics. More specifically, we developed an agent-based stochastic model for invasion of host cells by Salmonella bacteria. Using this model we were able to gain a quantitative understanding of the impact of the ruffling mechanism on the statistics and dynamics of invasion. A paper detailing these results is currently begin finalized.

		<p><strong>Modelling Intermolecular Cross-Linking in Collagen Fibrils</strong>.
		<p>Currently working on a coarse grained liquid-crystal elastomer model of cross-linked collagen fibrils as part of an honours thesis with professor Andrew Rutenberg. The goal is to better understand how intermolecular cross-linking determines the elastic properties of a fibril.
