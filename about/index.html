			<p>I grew up in Vancouver, but now live in Halifax. I'm in my fourth (and final) year of study at Dalhousie University, working on a bachelor's degree with honours in physics and mathematics. I'm really interested in the application of quantitative tools from the fields of physics and mathematics to complex problems in biology. Throughout my undergrad I have been involved in research in the field of biophysics, working with professor Andrew Rutenberg. Previous research has focused on using quantitative stochastic modelling to investigate cooperativity in the invasion process of <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria. Currently, as part of my honours research project, I am modelling the effects of strain on cross-linked collagen fibrils in an effort to understand the interplay between intermolecular cross-linking and the elastic properties of fibrils.

			<p>Some assorted non-academic interests of mine:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Singing:</strong> I've had a strong passion for classical choral music as long as I can remember, and have been singing in choirs since the age of 5. I have performed as a soloist with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, the Victoria Philharmonic Orchestra, the Vancouver Bach Choir, and others. I currently sing as a choral scholar with the University of King's College Chapel Choir directed by Paul Halley. You can listen to recordings of some of our concerts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kingschapelchoir">here</a>.</li>

				<li><strong>Skiing:</strong> I've loved skiing pretty much all my life. Whenever time, weather, and my location allow I can be found in the mountains shredding gnar and schlarping pow! <!--Growing up in Vancouver, I was lucky to be exposed to world class mountains and terrain. --> I'm a certified ski instructor (CSIA Level 1), and I am trained in avalanche risk evaluation and rescue (AST 1).</li>

				<li><strong>Running:</strong> My first three years at Dalhousie I was a member of the varsity track team. I specialized in middle distance events, and won a number of individual medals as well as team championships in the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) league over my time with the team.
				I left in my fourth year in order to free up time to pursue other interests, but still really enjoy trail and mountain running when I have the chance.</li>

			</ul>
